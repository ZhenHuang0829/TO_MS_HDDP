This repository is used for support simulations in our paper named "Holistic Trajectory Planning for On-Orbit Multi-Stage Assembly via RRT-Guided Time-Optimal Multiple-Shooting Hybrid DDP".
Here, we disply planning results of Scenario A, B and C in our paper.

# Scenario A: Hybrid Climbing and Assembly

# Scenario B: Sequential Multi-Module Assembly

# Scenario C: Space Telescope Assembly
